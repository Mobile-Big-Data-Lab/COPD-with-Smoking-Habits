Common Access Agreement
Preamble
After being approved by the ethics committee and other relevant units, we will make the original data set used in the article public to expand the beneficiary population of the open data set, so that clinicians, policy makers, public health care leaders and researchers can participate in the data Statistical analysis of datasets to clarify public health issues and better serve public datasets.However, by accepting the terms of the Common Access Agreement users are entering into a legally binding agreement.
NB: this preamble is an explanatory aid, not a legal instrument. Only the "Term" below are legally binding.
 

It is the aim of the data service to provide access to the available data set at no cost to end users. This aim can only be achieved if the organisations which supply data can be assured that their own rights are protected. Consequently, use of the data is covered by a variety of legal instruments to protect us, our users, and those who supply data to us.
 

The Common Access Agreement asks that users be fair and reasonable in their use of the data we supplied. We will levies no charges, there are no documents to sign, and none will be applied retrospectively. We do not hold information on specific users. In return we ask that you acknowledge the source and copyright of the data you use, that you tell us of any errors you find in it, and that if you undertake any work based substantially upon it, that you tell us about it and send us a copy of any subsequent publication. The data must not be sold or supplied to a third party.
 

The data should only be used for teaching, learning, and research purposes. By teaching, we mean directed teaching undertaken with a designated tutor in a formal setting. By learning we mean self-directed study, whether or not attached to an educational institution, including the educational activities undertaken in museums, libraries and cognate institutions. By research we mean any work undertaken for the advancement of medical and health knowledge and/or the understanding of the public health environment. Such work may be commercially sponsored or it may be funded by academic bodies or learned societies, or it may be unsupported: but it is a condition of use that the results are made accessible for others to use according to the normal principles of professional and academic practice.
